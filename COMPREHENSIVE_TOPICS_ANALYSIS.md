## **Why I Missed These Topics:**

1. **Previous Session Context**: I only had access to the current conversation, not the previous chat where you likely mentioned many more topics.

2. **Incremental Nature**: You kept adding topics throughout our conversation with phrases like "add these too" and "why not added any reason?" - indicating there were many more from earlier discussions.

3. **Focus on Implementation**: I was focused on creating the actual code implementations rather than maintaining a complete running list.

4. **Topic Scattered**: Topics were mentioned across different parts of our conversation, making it easy to miss some.

5. **Assumption of Completeness**: I assumed I had captured all topics from the current session, but clearly missed many from previous sessions.

## **Request for Complete List:**

To ensure I capture ALL topics you mentioned in previous conversations, could you please:

1. **Provide the complete list** of topics from your previous chat sessions
2. **Point out specific topics** I missed from earlier conversations
3. **Clarify which categories** need more comprehensive coverage

This will help me create a truly complete portfolio that covers every single topic you mentioned across all our conversations.

## **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Current session topics**: Captured and implemented
- ❌ **Previous session topics**: Likely missed many
- ❌ **Complete coverage**: Not achieved due to session limitations
- ❌ **Comprehensive list**: Needs your input for complete coverage

I apologize for missing so many topics from our previous conversations. Please help me identify what I missed so I can create a truly comprehensive portfolio.
